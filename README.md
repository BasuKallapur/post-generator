# LinkedIn Post Generator Using Generative AI

This project generates professional LinkedIn posts, articles, and engagement strategies using Generative AI. By utilizing AI-driven models, the application helps create posts in various lengths and languages (English and Hinglish) for content creators, job seekers, influencers, and marketers on LinkedIn.

The app is built using **Streamlit**, **LangChain**, **Groq**, and other essential libraries to interact with AI models, process data, and generate content dynamically.

## Features

- **Post Generation**: Generate LinkedIn posts based on topics, lengths, and languages.
- **Language Support**: English, Hinglish (Hindi + English) and Kannada.
- **Customizable Options**: Length of the post (Short, Medium, Long), Topic (Tags), and Language.
- **Integration with Few-Shot Learning**: AI uses previously processed posts as examples for content generation.

## Technologies Used

- **Streamlit** - Web framework for building the app.
- **LangChain** - A framework for language model interaction.
- **Groq API** - To interact with the language models.
- **Pandas** - For data manipulation.
- **Python-dotenv** - For managing environment variables.
- **JSON** - For storing raw and processed post data.
